Treatment options include topical medications (retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics), oral medications (antibiotics, hormonal therapy, isotretinoin), and various procedures like chemical peels and laser therapy."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Gallstones", "output": "Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that form in the gallbladder, a small organ beneath the liver that stores bile. They can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. There are two main types: cholesterol stones (most common) and pigment stones (made of bilirubin). Many people with gallstones have no symptoms, but when stones block bile ducts, they can cause sudden, intense abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Risk factors include obesity, rapid weight loss, high-fat diet, diabetes, and being female. Treatment ranges from watchful waiting for asymptomatic stones to surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) for symptomatic cases."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Zika virus", "output": "Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the same species that spreads dengue and chikungunya. Most people infected with Zika virus have no symptoms or only mild symptoms including fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes. However, Zika infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, including microcephaly (abnormally small head and brain). It can also be sexually transmitted and has been linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition. There's no specific treatment or vaccine for Zika virus. Prevention focuses on avoiding mosquito bites through repellents, protective clothing, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Multiple sclerosis", "output": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, where the immune system attacks the protective covering (myelin) of nerve fibers, causing communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. This leads to inflammation, scarring, and damage to nerve fibers. Symptoms vary widely but can include fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness, muscle weakness, vision problems, and cognitive changes. There are four main types: relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive, primary-progressive, and progressive-relapsing. While there's no cure, disease-modifying therapies can slow progression and manage symptoms. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications also play important roles in management."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "HIV", "output": "HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for fighting infections. If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV is transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk. Common transmission routes include unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Early HIV infection may cause flu-like symptoms, but many people remain asymptomatic for years. Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress the virus to undetectable levels, allowing people with HIV to live near-normal lifespans and preventing transmission to others."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Tetanus", "output": "Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin that affects the nervous system, causing severe muscle spasms and contractions. The bacteria are commonly found in soil, dust, and animal feces and enter the body through wounds, cuts, or puncture injuries. Symptoms include jaw cramping (lockjaw), painful muscle spasms, difficulty swallowing, and rigid abdominal muscles. Severe cases can cause breathing difficulties, bone fractures from muscle spasms, and death. Tetanus is entirely preventable through vaccination with the tetanus toxoid, typically given as part of the DTaP or Tdap vaccines. Treatment involves wound care, antibiotics, tetanus immunoglobulin, and supportive care in intensive care settings."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Scoliosis", "output": "Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that most often occurs during the growth spurt just before puberty. While the spine naturally has curves when viewed from the side, scoliosis involves abnormal lateral (side-to-side) curvature, often forming an 'S' or 'C' shape when viewed from behind. Most cases are idiopathic (unknown cause), but it can also result from conditions like cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, or birth defects. Symptoms may include uneven shoulders, prominent ribs, uneven waist, and in severe cases, breathing problems. Treatment depends on the severity and includes observation, bracing in growing children, and surgery for severe curves. Early detection through school screenings is important for optimal outcomes."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Rubella", "output": "Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection caused by the rubella virus. It's generally mild in children and adults, causing symptoms like low-grade fever, sore throat, and a characteristic red rash that starts on the face and spreads downward. However, rubella is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, as infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome, including heart defects, cataracts, hearing loss, and developmental delays. The virus spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Rubella is preventable through vaccination with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, and thanks to widespread vaccination, it has been eliminated in many countries."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Whooping cough", "output": "Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly contagious bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis that affects the respiratory system. It's characterized by severe coughing fits followed by a high-pitched 'whoop' sound when breathing in, though this classic symptom may not occur in all cases, especially in infants. The disease progresses through three stages: catarrhal (cold-like symptoms), paroxysmal (severe coughing fits), and convalescent (gradual recovery). Whooping cough is particularly dangerous for infants, who may develop complications like pneumonia, brain damage, or death. It's preventable through vaccination with the DTaP vaccine in children and Tdap booster in adolescents and adults. Treatment involves antibiotics, which are most effective when given early."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Scabies", "output": "Scabies is a contagious skin infestation caused by tiny mites called Sarcoptes scabiei that burrow into the skin and lay eggs. The condition causes intense itching, especially at night, and a red, bumpy rash. Common areas affected include the wrists, elbows, armpits, waist, and between fingers and toes. In infants and young children, the head, neck, palms, and soles may also be affected. Scabies spreads through direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact and can also spread through sharing bedding, clothing, or towels. Treatment involves prescription topical medications like permethrin cream or oral medications like ivermectin. All household members and close contacts should be treated simultaneously, and personal items should be washed in hot water or isolated."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Anxiety", "output": "Anxiety is a normal emotional response to stress, but anxiety disorders involve excessive, persistent worry and fear that interferes with daily activities. Common types include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Symptoms can be psychological (excessive worry, restlessness, difficulty concentrating) and physical (rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath). Anxiety disorders result from a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Treatment typically includes psychotherapy (particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy), medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications), lifestyle modifications, and stress management techniques. With proper treatment, most people with anxiety disorders can manage their symptoms effectively."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Conjunctivitis", "output": "Conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin membrane that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelids. It can be caused by viral infections (most common), bacterial infections, allergies, or irritants. Symptoms include redness, itching, burning, excessive tearing, and discharge that may be watery (viral) or thick and yellow-green (bacterial). Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious and often accompanies cold symptoms, while bacterial conjunctivitis may affect one or both eyes. Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious and often occurs with other allergy symptoms. Treatment depends on the cause and may include antibiotic drops, antihistamines, or supportive care."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Psoriasis", "output": "Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition that causes cells to build up rapidly on the skin's surface, forming thick, silvery scales and itchy, dry, red patches. The most common type is plaque psoriasis, but other forms include guttate, inverse, pustular, and erythrodermic psoriasis. It commonly affects the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back, but can occur anywhere on the body. Psoriasis is not contagious and results from an overactive immune system that speeds up skin cell growth. Triggers include stress, infections, certain medications, and weather changes. Treatment options include topical medications, phototherapy, and systemic medications for severe cases. Many people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Pancreatitis", "output": "Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, an organ behind the stomach that produces enzymes for digestion and hormones like insulin. It can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (long-term). Acute pancreatitis is often caused by gallstones or heavy alcohol use, while chronic pancreatitis is most commonly due to long-term alcohol abuse. Symptoms include severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, nausea, vomiting, fever, and rapid pulse. Acute pancreatitis can be life-threatening with complications like infection, bleeding, and organ failure. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes and digestive problems. Treatment involves pain management, IV fluids, nutritional support, and addressing underlying causes. Severe cases may require hospitalization and surgery."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Chikungunya", "output": "Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, the same species that spread dengue and Zika viruses. The name comes from a word meaning 'to walk bent over' in the Makonde language, referring to the stooped posture caused by joint pain. Symptoms typically appear 3-7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito and include sudden onset of fever, severe joint pain (particularly in hands and feet), headache, muscle pain, and rash. While rarely fatal, the joint pain can be debilitating and may persist for months or years. There's no specific treatment or vaccine; management focuses on symptom relief. Prevention involves controlling mosquito populations and avoiding mosquito bites."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Appendicitis", "output": "Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small tube-like structure attached to the first part of the large intestine. It's most commonly caused by blockage of the appendix opening, leading to bacterial infection and inflammation. Classic symptoms include abdominal pain that starts around the navel and shifts to the lower right abdomen, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The pain typically worsens with movement, coughing, or deep breathing. Appendicitis is a medical emergency because a ruptured appendix can lead to peritonitis (infection of the abdominal cavity) and sepsis. Diagnosis involves physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies. Treatment almost always requires surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy), which can be performed laparoscopically or through open surgery."}
{"instruction": "Explain this medical term", "input": "Glaucoma", "output": "Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, often due to increased pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure). It's a leading cause of blindness worldwide, particularly in older adults. The most common type is primary open-angle glaucoma, which develops slowly and often without symptoms until significant vision loss occurs. Angle-closure glaucoma is less common but can cause sudden symptoms like severe eye pain, headache, nausea, and blurred vision. Risk factors include age, family history, high eye pressure, thin corneas, and certain medical conditions like diabetes. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection, as vision loss from glaucoma is irreversible. Treatment includes prescription eye drops, laser therapy, or surgery to lower eye pressure and prevent further damage."}
